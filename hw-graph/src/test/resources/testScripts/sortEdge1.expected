# sortEdge1 testing file
# Tests that all the nodes in a graph can be
# printed out in alphabetical order and all
# the edges are sorted alphabetically too

# Create a graph
created graph graph1

# Add nodes
added node n1 to graph1
added node n2 to graph1
added node n3 to graph1

# Add edges
added edge e1 from n1 to n2 in graph1
added edge e2 from n2 to n3 in graph1
added edge e3 from n3 to n1 in graph1
added edge e4 from n1 to n2 in graph1
added edge e5 from n1 to n2 in graph1
added edge e6 from n2 to n3 in graph1
added edge e7 from n3 to n1 in graph1

# Print the children from a node and the outgoing edges
the children of n1 in graph1 are: n2(e1) n2(e4) n2(e5)
the children of n2 in graph1 are: n3(e2) n3(e6)
the children of n3 in graph1 are: n1(e3) n1(e7)
