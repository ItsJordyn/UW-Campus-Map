# GetChildren3 testing file
# Tests that the children nodes from a single node can be
# Printed out (Case with duplicate edges).

# Create a graph
created graph graph1

# Add 3 nodes
added node n1 to graph1
added node n2 to graph1
added node n3 to graph1

# Add edges
added edge e1 from n1 to n2 in graph1
added edge e1 from n1 to n2 in graph1
added edge e2 from n2 to n3 in graph1
added edge e3 from n3 to n1 in graph1

# Print the children from a node and the outgoing edges
the children of n1 in graph1 are: n2(e1)
the children of n2 in graph1 are: n3(e2)
the children of n3 in graph1 are: n1(e3)
