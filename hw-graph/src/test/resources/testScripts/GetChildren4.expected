# GetChildren4 testing file
# Tests that the children nodes from a single node can be
# Printed out (Node has an edge pointing to itself).

# Create a graph
created graph graph1

# Add three nodes
added node n1 to graph1

#Add edges
added edge e1 from n1 to n1 in graph1

# Print the nodes and the outgoing edges from n1
the children of n1 in graph1 are: n1(e1)
