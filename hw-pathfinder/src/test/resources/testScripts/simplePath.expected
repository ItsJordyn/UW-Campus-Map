# Find the shortest path with Dijkstra's algorithm

created graph simpleGraph

added node A to simpleGraph
added node B to simpleGraph
added node C to simpleGraph
added node D to simpleGraph

added edge 11.000 from A to B in simpleGraph
added edge 6.000 from A to D in simpleGraph
added edge 2.000 from A to C in simpleGraph
added edge 3.000 from C to D in simpleGraph
added edge 3.000 from D to B in simpleGraph

path from A to B:
A to C with weight 2.000
C to D with weight 3.000
D to B with weight 3.000
total cost: 8.000
