# Find a path with Dijkstra's algorithm when
# the path is from a node to itself

created graph simpleGraph

added node A to simpleGraph
added node B to simpleGraph
added node C to simpleGraph

added edge 9.000 from A to B in simpleGraph
added edge 2.000 from B to C in simpleGraph

path from A to A:
total cost: 0.000
