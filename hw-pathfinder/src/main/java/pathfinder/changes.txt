Briefly list any changes you made to your graph class during hw-pathfinder, and why you made those changes.

- I added the method edgesOut to my graph class, so I can retrieve the outgoing edges from a node
- turned off the debugger because my code was running way too long
- removed my getParents method, never used it
- Fixed the ListChildren command in the graph test driver
